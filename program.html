            The whole festival is about Golden Era but what actually is Golden Era? What do we mean by Golden Era bellydance? Is it one particular dance style, or are there any other branches? What time period do we talk about? Is it focused on Egypt, or any other parts of the world? This lecture, led by one of the organizers, Badriyah, will explain the most urgent questions about Golden Era, dance in movies, cabarets, and in what forms it has its come back nowadays.

She will also discuss the changes in costuming that have taken place since that era.

  Egyptian folklore existed long before Egyptian cinema and Cairo famous cabarets. What do we know about folklore in the pre-Golden Era? How was it later presented in the Egyptian cinema? Interestingly, more than a real folklore, with some rare and beautiful exceptions, one can see mostly character dances in the old Egyptian movies. Take a tour with Sheyla on how folklore was shown in the Golden Era times, learn some fascinating facts, listen to a few legends, and watch several rare movie clips showing real folklore versus character dances in the Egyptian movies.

 <p class="row__perex">
  The Golden Era of Raqs Sharqi peaked around 1940’ and 1950’. But what about Raqs Sharqi in the later time period of 1960’ and 1970’ in Egypt? Although some older legends such as Samia Gamal still performed, a new generation of dancers emerged, such as Nagwa Fouad or Suheir Zaki. They brought new dance moves and ideas, as well as followed the new trends in Raqs Sharqi, such as more hip accents, or extended usage of a veil. Shahrzad will guide you through the late Golden Era bellydance, including some of the most prominent technique and wrap up the beauty of 1960’ and 1970’ in a short dance combination. </p>

Of Stars And Signature Steps will focus on the trademark moves and styling of three of the most well-known Golden Era stars - Taheya Carioca, Samia Gamal and Naima Akef.

  <h4 id="birth" class="row__h4">Nisaa - Birth of Raqs Sharqi</h4>
 <p class="row__perex">
  The dance form now recognized as raqs sharqi was born on the stages of Egypt's urban entertainment halls at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.  But how?  And why?  What were the circumstances that set in motion such a momentous transformation of Egyptian belly dance at this particular point in Egyptian history?  In this lecture, Nisaa discusses the unique constellation of social, political, and cultural developments in late 19th century Egypt that enabled and nurtured the emergence and early development of raqs sharqi.  Join Nisaa and learn how the birth of raqs sharqi reflected broader trends in turn-of-the-century Egyptian arts and entertainment, and how cultural expressions like raqs sharqi embodied and expressed the struggle for Egyptian national and cultural identity.

  <h4 id="birth" class="row__h4">Nisaa - Early (Pre-Golden Era) Raqs Sharqi</h4>
 <p class="row__perex">
  Decades before the rise of Golden Era celebrities such as Taheya Carioca and Samia Gamal, Egyptian belly dance had made its way to the stages of Cairo's theaters and music halls. In those settings, the traditional dancing of Egypt's awalim and the ghawazi was transformed into the dance form now recognized as raqs sharqi.  In this workshop, join Nisaa for a movement exploration of raqs sharqi before the glamorous Golden Era. Nisaa will guide you through a reconstruction of the technique and aesthetic of raqs sharqi from the 1890s through the 1920s.  Explore how early raqs sharqi retained some aspects of awalim and ghawazi styles, and how innovative and foreign elements were absorbed into the dance over the course of this 40-year period.

  From Zuba el Klobatiyya to Nagwa Fouad, the dancers of Egypt's cinematic golden era brought their unique candelabra balancing dance to the silver screen in scenes varying from cabaret entertainment to upper class familial celebrations of matrimonial union or new births. In this workshop we'll explore the connection between the roots of raqs el-shamadan and its cinematic presentations as we learn movements and stylizations from the famous and lesser known dancers of this era to help us retain a "classic" look while performing this dance in modern venues. (No floorwork movements included in this workshop. No shamadan required, but bring it if you have it.)

  Description of the takht, that is, the music instruments used in the Early Raqs Sharqi ensemble (qanun, ud, nay, violin, riqq)
  Description of three main musical forms used: 1) the rondo type (Raqset Sayyed Mohammad); 2) Raqset el-Hawanem (Dance of the Noble Ladies) which consists of a series of sections in the same meter and the same melodic mode; 3) Dakhlet el-Awalem (Entrance of the Learned Ladies, i.e., dancers, who, it should be emphasized, were learned people in times past) which consists of many section in the same melodic mode but many different rhythmic modes, a real classic in the dance repertoire. If time permits, I will also include Raqset el-Romman (Dance of the pomegranate) which is in rondo form but include many melodic modes. Emphasis will also be put on the flirtatious aspects of these dances.
  I will illustrate these dances with a qanun without levers and likely built in the early 20th century, a real period instrument to bring back the sound of this glorious era.

  <h4 id="sagat" class="row__h4">Melissa Gamal - Sagat in Golden Era</h4>
 <p class="row__perex">
  Dancers in the Golden Era were versatile performers, who took on many different roles including singer, actor... and sometimes musician too! Many dancers of the time period were proficient and masterful Sagat players, and there is an established history of professional dancers in Egypt playing Sagat (brass finger cymbals) much before the start of the Golden Era. Let's take a trip back in time to understand the history and technique - and revive the Sagat playing of the Golden Era with a dance piece inspired by one of it's most famous icons, Taheya Carioca.
