      <p>
        Comparing Golden Era of bellydance with modern bellydance, one can come up with thousands of questions. Most of them do not have a simple answer but are worth discussing. Is it necessary to learn about history of Raqs Sharqi? Is studying Golden Era dance important if you are interested in modern and fusion bellydance? Is modern bellydance less artistic and elegant than in Golden Era? What is the difference in appearance of bellydance in media now and then? Shahrzad, Julia Farid, Shruti, and Nisaa will discuss these and other intriguing questions.

      <div class="main4__line"><hr class="main3__dashed"/></div>
      <p>
        Badriyah is the founder of Online Bellydance Museum based on her expansive collection of over 400 items depicting bellydancers (famous raqs sharqi dancers such as Samia Gamal, Tahia Carioca, and Badia Masabni, awaleem & ghawazee from (mostly) Egypt, and Westernized versions of oriental dancers including Little Egypt, and Salomé) across nearly 300 years. In this tour you will visit a little dance studio of Badriyah and go through the most exciting items in her collection, including signed photograph by Samia Gamal, antique photo of Shafiqa El Koptiya, movie brochures with Tahia Carioca, engraving of Egyptian dancers from 1738 and 1807, or a billboard from the 1950’s with Samia Gamal. This tour is FREE, but please register in advance.            </p>
